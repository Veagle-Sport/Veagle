## About
Veagle is a tech company providing smart recording cameras for sports facilities, enabling individuals of all levels to track their performance, analyze gameplay, and capture moments through an AI-driven system. The platform also acts as a digital scout, identifying talents and directly connecting them with clubs and academies by sharing their in-game stats and video highlights.

## This AI model ready to:
- **Player tracking:**  The model is equipped to maintain player identification throughout a match. Nonetheless, this process can be challenging due to frequent obstructions from other players or objects on the field, which we are actively working to improve.
- **Player re-identification:** We have integrated player re-identification into our AI system. This function faces complexities, especially when cameras are in motion or when players who look similar leave and re-enter the frame. Our team is diligently training the model to better handle these situations.
- **Calculate player activity:**
