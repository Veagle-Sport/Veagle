## About
Veagle is a tech company providing smart recording cameras for sports facilities, enabling individuals of all levels to track their performance, analyze gameplay, and capture moments through an AI-driven system. The platform also acts as a digital scout, identifying talents and directly connecting them with clubs and academies by sharing their in-game stats and video highlights.

## This AI model ready to:

- **Ball tracking:** Our AI model currently includes ball tracking capabilities. However, due to the ball's small size and its quick movements, particularly in high-resolution footage, this feature is still undergoing refinement to enhance its accuracy.
- **Player tracking:**  The model is equipped to maintain player identification throughout a match. Nonetheless, this process can be challenging due to frequent obstructions from other players or objects on the field, which we are actively working to improve.
- **Player re-identification:** We have integrated player re-identification into our AI system. This function faces complexities, especially when cameras are in motion or when players who look similar leave and re-enter the frame. Our team is diligently training the model to better handle these situations.

## What we promise: 
We are committing to ensuring that by the end of the AI-league, all the following functionalities in our model will be fully developed and operational:
- **Pitch Detection:** The ability to accurately detect and analyze the pitch layout.
- **Player Tracking:** Reliable detection of the ball, despite its rapid movements and small size.
- **Ball Detection:** Consistent tracking of individual players, managing identification despite occlusions.
- **Team Classification:** Effective classification of players into their respective teams.
- **Radar:** Effective classification of players into their respective teams.
